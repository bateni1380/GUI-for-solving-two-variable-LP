This is an educational project that shows graphical method for solving two-variable LP.

This program is written by C# and its a GUI that shows whats happening in a 2d visual graph.

I had written this code for one of my projects in linear programming course presented by Dr. Hooshmand On March 2021 in Amirkabir University of technology.

Here you can watch a 20 minutes presentation of this app by me.
